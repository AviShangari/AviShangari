# Hello, I'm Aaveg Shangari! 👋

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, where I maintain a 3.91 GPA and have consistently been honored on the President’s List.

👨‍💻 I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development. My projects range from developing advanced AI models, like **LidWatch**—a CNN-based system for detecting driver drowsiness under various conditions—to creating dynamic web applications for bug tracking.

📚 I have a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and systems programming, with practical experience in Python, Java, and C++. I also work with frameworks and libraries like React, Flask, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

🌟 Highlight Project: **Notes.AI**, an AI-powered note-taking mobile application that uses NLP techniques to organize and summarize notes, enhancing user experience across multiple devices.

🔍 Another notable project is **Forex Trading Bot**, a sophisticated tool that autonomously analyzes forex markets and executes trades based on advanced algorithmic strategies, demonstrating my interest in combining finance with technology.

🔧 I am always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge the norms and push the boundaries of technology. Feel free to reach out if you have an idea you'd like to discuss or a project you need a hand with!

📈 In my spare time, I indulge in developing trading bots and exploring the intersection of finance and technology.
